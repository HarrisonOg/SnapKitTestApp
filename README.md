# A small sample app showing the usage of the SnapKit Creative Kit
---
This app uses Easy Image for image picking (https://github.com/jkwiecien/EasyImage) and Easy Permission for permission setting (https://github.com/googlesamples/easypermissions).

Simple use case of selecting an image from the gallery and sending through Snapchat with a caption and attachment URL.

Next:
- [ ] Send Video
- [ ] Attach Sticker + position sticker
- [ ] Write caption before sending to Snapchat

Make sure to replace the client id in the Android manifest file with your own client id before trying to build and run the app.
