# A small sample app showing the usage of the SnapKit Creative Kit
---
This app uses Easy Image for image picking (https://github.com/jkwiecien/EasyImage) and Easy Permission for permission setting (https://github.com/googlesamples/easypermissions).

Simple use case of selecting an image from the gallery and sending through Snapchat with a caption and attachment URL.

Make sure to replace the client id in the Android manifest file with your own client id before trying to build and run the app.
